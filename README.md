### Get Intents

Retrieving all installed intents: ```/api/get_intents```

Example of a valid POST request:
```json
{
    "api_key": "test_key"
}
```

Example of (just two for briefness) an intent response:
```json
{
  "routingList": [
    {
      "appId": {
        "id": 187,
        "name": "org.onosproject.ifwd"
      },
      "key": "00:00:00:00:00:01/None00:00:00:00:00:04/None",
      "paths": [
        {
          "path": [
            "00:00:00:00:00:01/None",
            "of:0000000000000001",
            "of:0000000000000008",
            "of:000000000000000c",
            "of:000000000000000a",
            "of:0000000000000004",
            "00:00:00:00:00:04/None"
          ],
          "weight": 1
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "appId": {
        "id": 187,
        "name": "org.onosproject.ifwd"
      },
      "key": "00:00:00:00:00:05/None00:00:00:00:00:07/None",
      "paths": [
        {
          "path": [
            "00:00:00:00:00:05/None",
            "of:0000000000000005",
            "of:000000000000000a",
            "of:000000000000000c",
            "00:00:00:00:00:07/None"
          ],
          "weight": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Post Intent(s)

Submitting a new intent(s): ```/api/push_intent```
See python example in testClient directory.

If the new intent is valid and accpeted by ONOS, a ```200``` code will be returned, otherwise a ```406``` code will be returned. If there is an SPP active a `409` will be returned, and the intent will be rejected. To override an SPP, you must submit an intent with a user api_key with a higher level than the current spp. See `get_spp` to see what SPP's are active, and at what priority they are. 

Example of a valid new intent request:
```json
{
    "api_key": "test_key",
    "routes":[
        {
            "key": "00:00:00:00:00:01/None00:00:00:00:00:07/None",
            "route": [
                "00:00:00:00:00:01/None",
                "of:0000000000000001",
                "of:0000000000000007",
                "of:000000000000000c",
                "00:00:00:00:00:07/None"
            ]
        }
    ]
} ]
}
```

### Get Routes

Get routes between an access host and core host: ```/api/get_routes```

Example of a valid route POST request:
```json
{
    "api_key": "test_key",
    "key"  : "00:00:00:00:00:02/None00:00:00:00:00:08/None"
}
```

Example of a response, routes are listed from lowest hops to highest:
```json
{
    "key": "00:00:00:00:00:02/None00:00:00:00:00:08/None",
    "num_routes": "7",
    "routes": {
        "0": [
            "00:00:00:00:00:02/None",
            "of:0000000000000002",
